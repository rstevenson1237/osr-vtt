 * `docs/VectorMapSystem_Spec.md` §2.0/§2.1/§3.
 *
 * ONE coordinate space everywhere: cell-lattice (map) units, floats. `cellSize`
 * is a render-time concern only — nothing in this module knows about pixels,
 * Pixi, or Firebase. This is the pure-geometry layer; the render/LoS-build
 * boundary multiplies by `cellSize` once, uniformly (SPEC §2.0).
 *
 * These types are deliberately re-implemented (not imported) from the POC
 * sandbox per the scaffold's graduation rule, and are namespaced under
 * `map/vector/` so they never collide with the existing cellular map system
 * (`map/natural.ts` `Point`, `map/los.ts` `Segment`).
